    "The data for this project is real data provided to us by the HPI School of Design Thinking. You are given as input a table stored in CSV format in a file named ‘project4.csv’. This table has 321 rows and five columns. Each row corresponds\n",
    "to a student and the columns are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "< hash > < Sex > < Discipline > < Nationality > < Semester >\n",
    "\n",
    "- The < hash > field contains a cryptographic hash of the student’s name (for privacy reasons).\n",
    "- The sex field contains ‘m’ for male and ‘f’ for female.\n",
    "- The Discipline field contains one of the following seven entries:\n",
    "    ‘Business’, ‘Creative Disciplines’, ‘Engineering’, ‘Humanities’, ‘Life Sciences’, ‘Media’ or ‘Social Sciences’.\n",
    "- The Nationality field contains one of 37 nationalities, depending on the selfreported nationality of the student.\n",
    "- The Semester field contains the semester in which that student was enrolled. This is stored as a code that indicates the semester and year. For example, the students in Winter 2015 semester have WT-15 (for Winter Term), and the students enrolled in this semester have the code ST-17."
